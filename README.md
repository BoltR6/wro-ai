# WRO Future Engineers - Codebase
This repository will likely remain inactive until the VEX season 'ends' or until our team has more time on our hands. 

Written entirely in Rust given how, unlike VEX, there are no hardware safeguards. Rust's primary paradigm is its safety, making it perfectly suited for applications such as this.
